        <p>Hi! My name is Erin Hubbard, and I am so excited to share a little about myself with you. Web development is a second career for me. For thirteen years I have been a licensed and certified Physical Therapist Assistant, with most of that being in the skilled nursing setting with the geriatic population. And, I decided it was time for a career change. </p>

        <p>I have always been interested in computers, science and technology, and always admired those who could take on and develope technology. I just never thought it could be me! I assumed this career was for other people, and 'oh nice it would be to be one of those people.' And now, here I am, on my way to becoming 'one of those people!'</p>
